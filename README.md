# frontend-data

### Concept

My concept for this project is making a data visualisation in which you can compare the most popular artists and tracks of every country with how popular those aritsts and tracks are in the entire world. You can chose a country to compare on a map and then you can choose tracks or artists, to show just the tracks and artists that exist in the top 50 of the world and to remove or not remove a country after you clicked on it.
