# frontend-data

### Concept

My concept for week 1 is making a data cleaner. For this I made a small form in which you can put your data in a textarea and then enter which cleanings you do or don't want. When you submit the form you get the cleaned data and a table in which you can change the keys of all the questions. Also you can look at the answers and how many times they were answered.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository with `https://github.com/Daan-Zwarthoed/frontend-data.git`
1. Then run `npm install` to install the dependencies
1. Then run `npm run start` to start a localhost
